# Password-Manager
Password manager made in python with sqlite and Tkinter.  

# Requirements  
This project use TKinter, SQLite3 and base64 which come with the basic python installation so there should not be any trouble, anyways if you have any kind of error when cloning the repo just make sure you have them in your python installation path.  

# Usage 
To run the password manager open your terminal, go to the folder where it is saved and run: 

```bash
python login.py
```
If this doesn't work try running: 

```bash
python3 login.py
```

# Pending features
I haven't finished the feature to config or delete your passwords, but you can use SQL to do it, I promise the feature will be ready soon :).
